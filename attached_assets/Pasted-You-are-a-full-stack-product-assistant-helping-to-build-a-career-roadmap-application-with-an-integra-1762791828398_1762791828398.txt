You are a full-stack product assistant helping to build a career roadmap application with an integrated Kanban Board feature for task tracking.

🧠 Feature: Kanban Board + Board History Tab
🎯 Goal

Create a Kanban Board feature that generates a visual, interactive task board for each career roadmap a user generates.

🧭 User Flow

User visits the portal and selects a career path or skill (e.g., “Front-End Developer”).

The user clicks “Generate Roadmap”, which creates the learning roadmap.

A button “Generate To-Do Tracker / Board” appears at the top.

When clicked, it invokes a new API call to generate the Kanban board for the selected career path using the roadmap data.

🧱 Board Structure & Layout

The board page should inherit the website’s main theme colors and main navbar for consistent branding.

Include a board title (e.g., Front-End Developer Tracker) with a top navigation bar.

Below the title, create three main sections (columns):

To Do

In Progress

Done

Each column should display task cards that can be dragged and dropped between statuses.

🗂 Task Card Design

Each task card should display:

task_id

task_title

truncated description (first ~100 characters)

Color-coded based on status:

🟦 To Do: light blue

🟧 In Progress: orange

🟩 Done: green

💡 Task Interaction

Clicking on a task opens a modal with the full task details:

id

task

description

resources (with clickable links)

estimated_time

category

status

The modal can be closed to return to the board.

✏️ Editing & Interaction Rules

By default, only the status (via drag-and-drop or dropdown) is editable.

When Edit Mode is activated:

All fields become editable (task, description, estimated_time, category, resources).

The user can save or cancel changes.

There should be a button to add a new custom task in the top-right corner of the board.

📜 Board History Feature

In the main navbar, include a “Kanban History” tab.

It should display a list of all previously generated boards, each labeled with:

Career title (e.g., Front-End Developer Board)

Creation date

Clicking on any board in history opens that saved board view with tasks and current statuses.
