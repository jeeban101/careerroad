You are the coding AI developing the CareerRoad app — an AI-powered career roadmap generator that already includes authentication, user dashboard, dark theme UI, roadmap history, and AI roadmap generation using Gemini API.

Now, extend the existing “Choose your goal” section (where users currently select Current course and Desired role to generate a roadmap) by adding a new tab called “Build Skill.”

Here’s exactly what this new feature should do:

🏗️ Feature: “Build Skill” Tab (Skill Roadmap Generator)

Purpose:
Let users generate a personalized skill learning roadmap for any specific skill they want to develop, based on their current proficiency level and desired completion timeframe.

🖥️ UI & Flow Requirements:

Add a new tab beside the existing inputs (“Current course” and “Desired role”).
The tab title should be “Build Skill”.
When selected, show a new form area for skill roadmap generation.

Fields inside the “Build Skill” section:

Choose your skill → dropdown or searchable input (example: React.js, SQL, Machine Learning)

Current level of proficiency → single-choice selection with these options:

I don’t know anything about it

I have heard and know the gist of it

I used to know it but not done it lately

I am an expert and want to learn more

By when do you want to learn this? → dropdown with timeframe options:

24 hr

48 hr

3 days

1 week

2 weeks

4 weeks

3 months

6 months

Action Button:
Add a gradient button labeled “Generate Skill Roadmap.”
When clicked:

Validate that all fields are filled

Show a loading state (spinning indicator) while fetching

Call the Gemini API with a structured prompt (see below)

Once data is returned, display the generated skill roadmap below in a card-style layout (similar to existing roadmap design)

Display Results:
The roadmap shown should have:

Skill name and overview

Stages (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced) with duration, tasks, and resources

Milestones and expected outcomes

Optional button: “Save to My Roadmaps”

Styling:

Match the current dark theme and button gradients already used in CareerRoad.

Maintain the same card layout, shadow, and font styles.

🧩 Gemini Prompt (to use inside the app):

When the user clicks “Generate Skill Roadmap,” the app should call the Gemini API using this prompt:

You are CareerRoad AI, an expert mentor in career and skill development.

The user wants to build a specific skill. Use the details below to create a personalized, realistic skill-learning roadmap.

User details:
- Current course: {{currentCourse}}
- Desired role: {{desiredRole}}
- Skill: {{selectedSkill}}
- Current proficiency level: {{proficiencyLevel}}
  (Options: "I don’t know anything about it", "I have heard and know the gist of it", 
   "I used to know it but not done it lately", "I am an expert and want to learn more")
- Target timeframe: {{timeFrame}}
  (Options: 24 hr, 48 hr, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months)

Your task:
Generate a clear, achievable learning roadmap to help the user learn or master this skill within the given timeframe.

Each roadmap should include:
1. Skill Overview — what the skill is and why it’s relevant to their desired role.
2. Learning Stages — divided by time (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
3. Specific Tasks — actionable steps for each stage.
4. Resources — credible online links or free courses.
5. Milestones — checkpoints for tracking progress.
6. Expected Outcome — what the user will be able to do at the end.

Respond **only** with valid JSON in this format:
{
  "skill": "string",
  "proficiencyLevel": "string",
  "timeFrame": "string",
  "overview": "string",
  "stages": [
    {
      "stage": "string",
      "duration": "string",
      "tasks": ["string"],
      "resources": ["string"]
    }
  ],
  "milestones": ["string"],
  "expectedOutcome": "string"
}

📦 Data Handling:

Store the returned roadmap in Supabase under the logged-in user’s account (like existing roadmaps).

Save the full Gemini response as JSON for reuse in “My Roadmaps.”

Optionally show a toast notification like:
“Your skill roadmap for [Skill] has been generated successfully!”

✅ Expected Output Behavior:

When a user fills the form and clicks “Generate Skill Roadmap,” they should instantly see a personalized skill plan like this:

Skill: React.js
Timeframe: 2 weeks
Overview: React.js is a JavaScript library for building UI...
Stages:

Beginner (3 days): Learn JSX and basic components

Intermediate (5 days): Hooks, Routing, and API calls

Advanced (6 days): Performance optimization, Deployment
Milestones: Day 3 – Built first component, Day 8 – API-integrated app, Day 14 – Deployed app
Expected Outcome: Able to build and deploy a modern React app.
