You are the coding AI developing the CareerRoad app — an AI-powered platform that helps users generate personalized career and skill roadmaps using Gemini API.

The app already includes:

Authentication and Supabase backend

Roadmap generation via Gemini

“Build Skill” feature where users select a skill, proficiency, and timeframe

A functional but static roadmap view

Now, revamp the “Build Skill” roadmap visualization into an engaging, interactive, and gamified learning experience that keeps users motivated and makes them want to learn inside the app instead of leaving.

🎯 Objective

Transform the current static roadmap (a list of stages, tasks, and resources) into a progressive, step-based, learning journey that feels dynamic, visual, and interactive — not just a document to read.

🧭 Core Redesign Requirements

Visual Journey Layout

Replace the long scroll with a horizontal or step-based learning flow (like a journey or timeline).

Each stage (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced) should appear as a step with progress lines connecting them.

The user can click each step to expand and view that stage’s tasks, milestones, and resources.

Interactive Tasks

Make each “Task” checkable — users can mark it as done.

When a task is completed, show a mini animation (like a checkmark pulse or XP counter).

Show a stage progress bar (“3/7 tasks done”) and an overall roadmap completion bar at the top.

Clickable, Rich Resource Cards

Replace plain links with visually rich resource cards that include:

Icons based on resource type (📺 YouTube, 📘 Docs, 💻 CodePen)

Buttons like “Open” and “Preview”

Embedded YouTube/CodePen previews inside modals

Make them colorful, clickable, and exciting — not plain text.

Gamified Learning

Introduce a XP and Badge system:

+10 XP per completed task

+50 XP per completed stage

Badges for finishing all stages (“Skill Mastered 🎓”)

Add a top-right “XP meter” showing progress and small celebratory animations (like confetti or emoji bursts) when levels or badges unlock.

In-App Learning Mode

Add a simple note-taking area below each stage: “Add your notes or reflections.”

Store notes locally or in Supabase (if available).

Let users reopen a stage and review their notes anytime.

Motivational Feedback

Show encouraging messages dynamically:

“🔥 You’re on fire — 60% done!”

“Nice work! You’ve mastered Stage 2!”

“Keep going — your next milestone is in sight 🚀”

These should appear after task/stage completion or progress updates.

Animations & Feel

Use smooth GSAP or Framer Motion animations for transitions between stages, expanding sections, and task completions.

Avoid overloading — subtle, clean motion that feels rewarding.

Example: cards slide up, progress bars animate, checkboxes pulse, and confetti triggers on full completion.

Clean Visual Theme

Keep CareerRoad’s dark gradient theme (purple → pink) but add subtle neon accents per stage.

Give each stage a color identity (e.g., Beginner = purple, Intermediate = blue, Advanced = green).

Use glowing icons, soft shadows, and smooth hover transitions.

📚 User Flow Summary

User enters skill, proficiency, and timeframe → clicks Generate Skill Roadmap.

Gemini API returns a JSON roadmap (same structure as now).

The new interactive layout renders:

Step-by-step roadmap

Progress bars and XP

Clickable resources

Notes and reflections

As the user marks tasks, progress updates dynamically with visual feedback and gamified rewards.

When the roadmap is completed, show a “🎉 Congratulations — You’ve mastered [Skill]!” modal with share option.

🌈 Desired Vibe

Think of this as Notion meets Duolingo meets roadmap.
It should feel alive, motivating, and satisfying to interact with — not like reading a document.
Every click, animation, and card should feel rewarding and guide the user’s learning journey visually.

⚡ Key Goals to Keep in Mind

Make users want to stay and learn — reduce drop-off by adding interactivity.

Focus on visual clarity, progression, and a sense of achievement.

Maintain accessibility and performance (light animations, semantic HTML).

Keep the same backend and Gemini integration — only transform how the roadmap is visualized and interacted with.
