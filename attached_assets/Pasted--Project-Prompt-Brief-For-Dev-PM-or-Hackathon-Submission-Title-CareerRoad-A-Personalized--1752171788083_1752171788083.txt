Title: CareerRoad – A Personalized Roadmap Generator for Gen Z’s Career Confusion

Problem:
Students and early graduates often feel lost when navigating from college to their first career — they don't know what skills to build, what tools to learn, which internships matter, or what steps to follow. There's no clear, personalized path that says: "You're here — do this next."

Solution:
CareerRoad is a web app that helps students generate structured, step-by-step career roadmaps from their current course (e.g., B.Com) to their dream role (e.g., Product Manager at Zomato). These roadmaps include curated learning resources, skill checklists, milestone timelines, and peer-sharable plans that can be customized and remixed.

Why Now:
Gen Z in cities like Bangalore is highly online, ambitious, and confused. They don't want vague advice — they want clear, credible, personalized paths. CareerRoad fills that gap with structure, social remixability, and transparency.

🔨 V1 — What We Are Building (Non-AI Version)
✅ Key Features:
Goal Selector Form

User chooses:

Current course/degree (e.g., B.Com, B.Tech, B.Sc)

Target career role (e.g., Product Manager, UX Designer, Data Analyst)

Static Roadmap Templates

Based on the combo, we fetch a prewritten roadmap from local JSON (or Supabase DB)

Each roadmap is structured by:

🧠 Skills to build

🧰 Tools to learn

📚 Resources to use

📆 Suggested timeline (semesters/weeks)

✅ Mini checklists (e.g., "Create mock PRD")

UI Output: Career Roadmap View

Render in a timeline or column format

Each "phase" has:

Title

Weeks covered

Steps (skills, tools, tasks, resources)

Fork + Customize

Allow users to remix the roadmap:

Add/remove steps

Edit deadlines or tools

Save their own custom version

Waitlist Form

Users can join the waitlist with name, email, college

Store in Supabase (or Google Sheet for MVP)

📅 Timeline Plan
Week	Task
Week 1	Build landing page + roadmap viewer UI
Week 2	Create 3–5 static roadmap templates
Week 3	Add "Fork" UI + Waitlist form + Deploy
Week 4	Polish UX and test with 5–10 students

🔮 Later (AI-Powered V2 — with Gemini / GPT-4 API)
Once the MVP is validated, we can:

Auto-generate career roadmaps using Gemini or GPT-4

Use prompts like:

“Create a 3-month roadmap for a B.Com student to become a Product Manager at Zomato — include resources, tools, projects, and prep material.”

Let users “ask” for any career goal, and dynamically generate the roadmap JSON

Add feedback loops (thumbs up/down per roadmap phase)
